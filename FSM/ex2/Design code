//Design of a serial parity detector
//A continuous stream of bits is fed to the circuit in synchronism with a clock. The circuit will be generating a continuous bit stream as output, where 1 indicates "odd no. of ones seen so far" and 0 indicates "even no. of ones seen so far"
// This is a Moore machine
